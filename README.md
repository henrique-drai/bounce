# Full-Stack Engineer Challenge

Hi! This is my answer to your challenge. I used React with Sass, as you can see.
I was having too much fun with the css and I ended up styling the whole app.

## How to run this project

Assuming you have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, this is all you have to do:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## About the card number input

I didn't fight too much over it and I just made a simple (but pretty unusable) input in order to separate every 4 digits. In a normal situation, I would have searched for a library to do this for me.
The input validation goes like this: "4242 4242 4242 4242" is the only number that results in a successful booking. Any other number will send you back to the input stage.
